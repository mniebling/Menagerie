# Menagerie

Menagerie is a place for me to put very small code snippets that I might want to keep for later. Maybe they're useful library type pieces, or experiments, or places for me to try out new techniques, or who knows what.



### Demo pages

* [Avatars]: Styles for user avatar images
* [SegmentedRadioButtons]: Turn radio buttons into a flat button group
